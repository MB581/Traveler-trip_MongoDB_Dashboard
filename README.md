## Dashboard Overview

>The dashboard, built on MongoDB Atlas, offers interactive visualizations. [Traveler_trip_dataset](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6729145-ba6e-46e0-907a-e64910d8f537)<br>

>The Traveler Trip Dataset Dashboard provides a detailed analysis of travel patterns, preferences, and costs across various destinations. It highlights destination popularity segmented by gender, accommodation preferences (e.g., Bali's dominance in resort stays), and average trip durations. Transportation mode usage, traveler demographics, and age distributions offer insights into traveler behavior, while charts on costs (total, transportation, and accommodation) across destinations such as Paris and London reveal spending trends and trade-offs. A word cloud visualizes the most visited locations, and a global map illustrates the geographical distribution of travelers. These insights are complemented by scatter and line plots analyzing relationships between trip durations, transportation types, and costs, making the dashboard a comprehensive tool for data-driven decision-making in travel and tourism.
